# final-warm-project
Hi!
We are a group of data analysts who are committed to carrying out a complete analysis relating to the rise in global temperatures, which is the object of the Paris Agreement.
We compared this with various variables to understand how CO2 emissions, population and GDP of various countries around the world could affect it.
The project is made up of slides, the dataset we created, all the tests carried out on the data we collected, a very intuitive interactive visualization and a code to periodically find new relevant datasets to possibly implement in our analyses!
We wanted the project to be able to be updated over time so as to always reflect current events.
